ActsAsSeekable
==============

This plugin allows you to make your models seekable (searchable) by combining
filter params with order and search params. The values in the order and search params
will be used as lambda values for ordered_by and search named_scopes. Values in the
filter param will be treated as named_scopes. Since this plugin works based on
named_scopes, it will add an all_records and ordered_by named_scope to all models that have acts_as_seekable in them, you must create your own search named_scope for the seek (search) functionality to work and aditional named_scope for each filter you want.
When sending the filter param to the seek method, it is very important that you have
a named_scope called like the value of the parameter, or else it wont work.
You can specify if your seach will be paginated or not, it will use mislav-will_paginate
plugin to perform pagination, if you don't that gem installed acts_as_seekable
will ingnore the :paginate param.


Example
=======

  Example with mislav-will_paginate:

    acts_as_seekable :paginate => true
          or
    acts_as_seekable :paginate => :true
          or
    acts_as_seekable :paginate => "true"

    named_scope :search, lambda { |search| conditions.... }
  ----------------------------------------------------------------

  Example without mislav-will_paginate:

    acts_as_seekable   #short way
          or
    acts_as_seekable :paginate => false #long way
          or
    acts_as_seekable :paginate => :false #long way
          or
    acts_as_seekable :paginate => "false" #long way

    named_scope :search, lambda { |search| conditions.... }
